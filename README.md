# Mod Info
AutoRegister is a TShock plugin created to automatically register new users on SSC enabled servers. 

# How it works
When a new user joins a server AutoRegister checks to see if there is already a user present with their name/uuid. If there isn't, a new user is automatically created for them. The password which is generated is then posted in chat for them to either save, or change.
